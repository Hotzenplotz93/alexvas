            Manti (Kazakh: мәнті, mänti, مأنتى, Turkish: mantı, Uzbek: manti,
            monti, Armenian: մանթի), also manty (Kyrgyz: манты; Russian: манты;
            Tatar: манты), mantu (Pashto, Persian, Arabic: منتو‎; Tajik: манту)
            or manta (Uyghur: مانتا‎, manta, monta, манта, монта), is a type of
            dumpling popular in most Turkic cuisines, as well as in the cuisines
            of the South Caucasus, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Balkans, Bukharan
            Jews and Chinese Muslims. Mantu is also famous in Pakistan city
            Peshawar. Manti are also consumed throughout Russia and other
            post-Soviet countries, where the dish spread from the Central Asian
            republics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dumplings typically consist of a spiced meat mixture, usually
            lamb or ground beef in a dough wrapper and either boiled or steamed.
            Size and shape vary significantly depending on the geographical
            location. Manti resemble the Chinese jiaozi and baozi, Korean mandu,
            Mongolian buuz and the Tibetan momo and the dish's name is cognate
            with the Korean mandu, Chinese mantou and Japanese manjū, although
            the Chinese and Japanese counterparts refer to different dishes. The
            name, depending on the language, can refer to a single dumpling or
            to more than one dumpling at a time; in English, it is often used as
            both a singular and plural form.

            The origin is somewhat uncertain. While the Chinese word mantou has
            been suggested as the origin for the word manti, different Chinese
            characters have been used to address same food in the past which
            indicates the Chinese attempted to adapt a foreign word to their
            writing system. However, the term mantou (饅頭) already appears in
            early records of Jin dynasty (266CE-420CE), and similar foods were
            already produced and consumed in earlier periods. Different Chinese
            synonyms of the same foods such as manshou (饅首)" and zhenbing
            (蒸餅) were also already in use. Originally, mantou was meat-filled.
            Mantou still retains its old meaning of stuffed bun in Wu Chinese as
            moedeu. But in Mandarin and many other varieties of Chinese, mantou
            refers to plain steamed buns, while baozi resembles the ancient
            mantou stuffed with meat.

            The earliest written Ottoman mantı recipe appears in a 15th-century
            cookbook written by Muhammed bin Mahmud Shirvani. The version in
            Shirvani's book is a steamed dumpling with a minced lamb and crushed
            chickpeas filling spiced with cinnamon and flavored with vinegar.
            The dish was garnished with sumac and like most contemporary mantı
            variations, it was served with a garlic-yoghurt sauce.

            Manti in Central Asian cuisines are usually larger in size. They are
            steamed in a multi-level metal steamer called mantovarka,
            mantyshnitsa (Russian terms for manti cooker), manti-kazan or
            manti-kaskan (manti pot). It consists of layered pans with holes
            that are placed over a stock pot filled with water. Steaming is the
            main method of cooking manti; if boiled or fried, they are
            considered another type of dumpling, such as pelmeni.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Kazakh cuisine, the manti filling is normally ground lamb
            (sometimes beef or horse meat), spiced with black pepper, sometimes
            with the addition of chopped pumpkin or squash. This is considered
            to be a traditional Uyghur recipe. Manti are served topped with
            butter, sour cream or an onion sauce or garlic sauce. When sold as
            street food in Kazakhstan, manti are typically presented sprinkled
            with hot red pepper powder.

          <p>
            In Afghan cuisine, the mantu are filled with beef or lamb mixed with
            minced onions and spices, steamed and then topped with a very
            typical sauce (seer mosst, lit. ‘garlic yoghurt’) of yoghurt, dried
            or fresh mint, lemon juice and minced or pressed garlic. The mantu
            are also typically topped with a very small amount of tomato-based
            sauce which can include split peas, red kidney beans and/or some
            sautéed ground meat.
          </p>
          <p>
            The amount of yoghurt sauce is typically much greater than the
            tomato sauce; the tomato sauce is meant to be dotted on top - not
            covering the dish. Chutney, a spicy green or red pepper condiment
            sauce, may be sprinkled on top. Many Afghans also like to serve
            mantu with a carrot qorma or stew, instead of a tomato-based sauce.
            Now it is also famous in some areas of Pakistan due to Afghan
            refugees.

          <p>
            In contrast to the Central Asian varieties, manti in Anatolia and
            Transcaucasia are usually boiled or baked rather than steamed and
            tend to be small in size. In modern Turkish cuisine, manti are
            typically served topped with yoghurt and garlic, and spiced with red
            pepper powder and melted butter, and topped with ground sumac and/or
            dried mint by the consumer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, the Armenian manti, also sometimes referred to as monta,
            are usually served with yoghurt (matzoon) or sour cream (ttvaser)
            and garlic, accompanied by clear soup (mantapour). Manti are more
            common among western (Cilician) Armenians, while among eastern
            Armenians, Georgians and Azerbaijanis, similar dumplings called
            khinkali are more prevalent.

          <p>
            In Bosnian cuisine, the name klepe or kulaci is used. These are made
            of minced meat with onions. It is served in a sauce consisting of
            yogurt and garlic. There is also a separate dish called mantije,
            which is made of the same ingredients, but the pastry balls are put
            together with no free space in between and baked. After the baking
            yogurt is poured on top. This second type is considered to be a pita
            or burek rather than manti, and is primarily made in the region of
            Sandžak.
